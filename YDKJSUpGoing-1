hello All, I am starting with You Dont Know Js series - Up and Going.
Please find my below finding for Chapter 1

--> Executing a program.
  For some computer languages, this translation of commands is typically done from top to bottom, line by line, every time the program is run, which is usually called interpreting the code.

  For other languages, the translation is done ahead of time, called compiling the code, so when the program runs later, what's running is actually the already compiled computer instructions ready to go.

  It's typically asserted that JavaScript is interpreted, because your JavaScript source code is processed each time it's run. But that's not entirely accurate. The JavaScript engine actually compiles the program on the fly and then immediately runs the compiled code.
